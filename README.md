### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-->
##### I'm a man from the city and I like to have a lot of options. ;O My first option is Architecture design, but optionally I also check what Web design looks like. My other options to check up, are:
- Movies: www.imdb.com/user/ur54675836
- Music: www.youtube.com/channel/UCc_bWyxaqEUOHj__Jr5oWQA
